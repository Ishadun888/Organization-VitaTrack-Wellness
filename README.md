This repository contains a Power BI dashboard assignment developed for VitaTrack Wellness to explore and visualize health and activity data. As a data analyst, I utilized Power BI to gain actionable insights into lifestyle patterns, risk factors, and health outcomes such as heart disease prevalence, physical activity, and sleep habits.
